# Python Practice

This is my little corner for practicing Python. Inside the `Excercises/` folder, you'll find all sorts of random scriptsâ€”some are just for fun, others are for learning new things or testing ideas.

Feel free to look around, run any script you like, or use them as inspiration for your own practice!
